  <h3>File Handle Leaks</h3>

  <p>
    Always remember to close files after opening them, usually with a defer
    statement!
  </p>

  <p>
    Worried you might have a file handle leak? Run `watch lsof -p <PID>` to
    keep tabs on all the files your process is using; if you suspect you
    have an issue with runaway TCP connections, you might even want to use
    grep to only look at the sockets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Strace is another great tool for diagnosing file leaks. Run `strace -p
    <PID>` to see all
    the system calls your program is making. You'll see a bunch of
    nonsense, but maybe something will stand out.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a series of files are opened within a for loop, use a defer
    statement <i>outside</i> the loop to make sure they all get closed.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <h3>Unclosed Database Connections</h3>
  <p>
    Any time a database connection is opened via sql.DB.Begin(), it must
    eventually be closed with tx.Rollback() or tx.Commit(). If
    transactions are not closed, MySQL will eventually start rejecting
    connections with the message "Too many open connections."
  </p>
  <p>
    If you suspect you have a database connection leak,
    enter your MySQL console and run `show processlist` -- a steadily
    growing list of running queries means something isn't closing!
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, after executing a query against a database, make sure to
    close your *sql.Rows object! Otherwise subsequent queries will give
    you errors.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="info-box">
  <h3>Neverending Keep-Alives</h3>
  <p>
    By default, Go's http client will keep network connections open after
    a request has been satisfied so the connection can be be reused. But
    this can result in connections (and the file handles they rely on)
    piling up.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also watch out for hanging TCP connections - the default HTTP client
    does not have a timeout, so connections to a server that never
    responds may stay around longer than desired. Use net.DialTimeout if
    you're dialing directly; change the Dial method of your HTTP client's
    transport to use DialTimeout; and/or set a timeout directly on your
    client. The client's timeout will be enforced if no response is
    received in time.
    <code>
    client := http.Client{
        Timeout: time.Duration(5 * time.Second),
    }
    </code>

    Whereas a dial timeout goes into effect if the intial dial does not
    go through.
    <code>
      client := http.Client{
          Transport: &http.Transport{
              Dial: func(network, addr string) (net.Conn, error) {
                  return net.DialTimeout(network, addr, timeout)
              }
          }
      }
    </code>
  </p>

  <p>
    Speaking of HTTP, response bodies returned by <code>http.Get</code>,
    <code>http.Post</code> need to be closed (generally, you'll just throw
    a <code>defer resp.Body.Close()</code> in there. TCP connection
    objects returned by net.Dial also need to be closed! What's wrong with
    this picture (used to test a system's ability to make external
    requests)?
    <code>
      _, err := net.Dial("tcp", "google.com")
    </code>
  </p>

  <h3>But No Matter What Happens... Remember Not to Panic!</h3>
  <p>
    Panics can be caused by accessing a slice or
    array at an out-of-range index, so always check the length of
    arrays before accessing their members.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lastly, remember that unchecked errors can be deadly!
